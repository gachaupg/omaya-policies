            upholding the trust of our users, partners, and regulators.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            OMAYA EXCHANGE operates in accordance with international best practices, including
            guidelines issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), as well as relevant local
            regulatory authorities, including the Central Bank of Somalia. We recognize our
            responsibility to contribute actively to the fight against financial crime, particularly in
            emerging markets where the risks may be heightened.
          </p>

            This policy applies to all OMAYA EXCHANGE users, employees, management, affiliates,
            and third-party service providers involved in any aspect of our operations. It forms an

          <p className="mb-4">
            Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a comprehensive set of laws, regulations, and
            procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as
            legitimate income. AML frameworks are enforced by financial institutions and virtual asset
            service providers (VASPs) to detect, monitor, and report suspicious financial activities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            At OMAYA EXCHANGE, we recognize that trading platforms can be misused by individuals
            or organizations seeking to legitimize proceeds of crime. Therefore, we are committed to
            establishing a robust AML compliance program that aligns with international standards and
            national regulatory obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            AML compliance is not just a legal requirement; it is a fundamental part of our mission to
            protect the integrity of our platform, support the fight against financial crime, and promote
            a secure environment for all users.

            The primary objectives of OMAYA EXCHANGE's AML Policy are to:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">4. Anti-Money Laundering and the FATF</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The global framework for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) gained momentum with the
            establishment of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 1989. As an intergovernmental
            body, FATF was created to develop international standards and promote effective
            implementation of legal, regulatory, and operational measures for combating money
            laundering, terrorist financing, and other threats to the integrity of the global financial
            system.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            FATF's 40 Recommendations serve as the cornerstone of international AML efforts and
            provide a framework for countries to implement effective measures. FATF regularly
            assesses member countries and identifies jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their
            AML regimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a digital asset platform operating in a globally interconnected environment, OMAYA
            EXCHANGE fully aligns its AML policies with FATF guidelines and the evolving standards of
            the global financial community. We are also committed to compliance with directives from
            the Central Bank of Somalia and other relevant regional authorities.

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Illegally obtained funds are introduced into the financial system through deposits, purchases, or other entry points.</li>
            <li><strong>Layering:</strong> A series of complex transactions are performed to obscure the origin of the funds. This may involve transfers between multiple accounts, conversion into digital assets, or other financial instruments.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration:</strong> The laundered funds are reintroduced into the legitimate economy and may appear to come from lawful sources.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.</li>
            <li>Verification of Identity: All users must provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., passport, national ID, or driver's license).</li>
            <li>Proof of Address: Recent (within 3 months) utility bills or bank statements clearly showing the customer's name, full address, date of issue, and issuing authority.</li>
            <li>Credit/Debit Card Verification: Users must upload a copy showing only the last four digits (with CVV covered) to ensure transaction security.</li>
            <li>Name Screening: Customers are screened against global sanctions and terrorist watchlists to ensure they are not listed or affiliated with any high-risk entities or persons.</li>
            <li>Transaction Monitoring: User activities and transactions are continuously reviewed to detect unusual patterns or suspicious behavior.</li>
            <li>Source of Funds and Wealth Assessments: Where necessary, users must demonstrate the legitimate origin of their funds.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            OMAYA EXCHANGE enforces a withdrawal policy that requires funds to be sent back to
