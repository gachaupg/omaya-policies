                Users should be aware that when conducting transactions on the
                OMAYA Express Exchange, they may be subject to network fees.
                These fees are not determined by OMAYA but are levied by the
                underlying blockchain providers to process and validate
                transactions on their respective networks. The magnitude of
                these network fees can vary and is contingent upon the specific
                blockchain involved. It's important to understand that network
                fees for cryptocurrencies are a necessary component to ensure
                the security and functionality of decentralized networks. OMAYA
                reserves the right to deduct these network fees from all
                transactions conducted on our platform. Users are advised to
                familiarize themselves with the network fees associated with
                each blockchain to avoid any unexpected charges.

                All fees, sales and exchanges processed through OMAYA Express
                Exchange are final, and no refunds will be issued under any
                circumstances. It's imperative for users to understand that once
                a transaction is completed and the requested assets have been
                sent, it becomes irreversible, and we cannot facilitate a
                refund. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means
                that once assets are sent, they cannot be retracted or canceled.
                Furthermore, if users inadvertently send an incorrect asset or
                fail to send the specific asset stipulated on our platform
                during a transaction, we cannot provide a refund or reverse the
                transaction. Given the immutable nature of blockchain
                transactions, users are strongly advised to double-check all
                transaction details and ensure they are sending the correct
                assets from the correct blockchain network to the specified
                addresses.
